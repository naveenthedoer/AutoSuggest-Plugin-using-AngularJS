AutoSuggest-Plugin-using-AngularJS
==================================

An auto suggest JavaScript Plugin. This is Similar to facebook auto sugggest of usernames developed with AngularJS.

If you comment in a textarea/input and would like to add your friends link to the comment, this plugin helps you. 
Whenever you want to add a friend to the comment start with "@" and start typing your friend name. 
It automaticallly shows you a popup of friends list in your page (it all depends on the criteria and database content you would like).
This is a basic version where I didn't connect to any database but created a JavaScript object of names and their links.
Also it does Highlight the name of the friend entered into the comment and then converts it into a link to his page on posting the comment(Again it all depends to which page you woud like to direct).
You can also remove the username from the comment in textarea on backspace keypress.
It is a basic version, more additions to come.
